I am a PhD student in Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on plasma physics and the dynamics of space-charge-dominated charged-particle systems, including short-pulse electron beams, plasma–surface interactions, and sheath physics. My work combines analytical modeling with fluid and kinetic simulations to study charged-particle dynamics across a range of plasma and vacuum regimes. My broader scientific interests include numerical methods for plasma modeling, particle-in-cell simulations, and the use of physics-informed and data-driven approaches in computational plasma physics.
