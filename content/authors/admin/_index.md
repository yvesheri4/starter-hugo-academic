Graduate student at Michigan State University, interested in modeling and computational methods of plasma dynamics. I am currently working on the numerical evaluation of the classical Child-Langmuir limit for short-pulsed electron beams in planar diodes.

Previously, I completed a second Master's degree at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Rwanda, working on the application of machine learning in electrical engineering where I developped an electricity loss assessment and mitigation framework for the Rwandan Energy Group.

I did my first Master's degree at the University of Lubumbashi in electrical engineering where I worked on the optimal control of photovoltaic panels with automatic orientation and maximum power point tracking.
